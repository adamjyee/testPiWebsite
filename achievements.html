<h3>NTU Archery Social Secretary and Wellbeing Officer 2021/2022</h3>
<p>
This role has required me to:
<ul>
<li>do some coaching of beginners</li>
<li>make sure people are comfortable and happy when at events</li>
<li>organise and run events</li>
</ul>
This has been incredibly rewarding, and has even improved my own shooting.<br>

<h2>Scouting Young Leader</h2>
I volunteered at 3rd Reading Scout Group for 3 years between 2017 and 2020.<br>
This was very rewarding, teaching me about conflict resolution, and working with people of different ages.<br>
By people of different ages, I do not just mean the Scouts, but also the other leaders, who were generally much older than me.<br>
